# React Ottawa Talk - React/GraphQL Auth

This is the front end for my talk at React Ottawa on authentication in React + GraphQL apps. The backend can be found [here](https://github.com/chenkie/react-graphql-auth-server). It needs to be run separately.

To run the app:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app will be served at `localhost:3000`.
